When Microsoft launched Windows 11, they declared it to be the most secure version of the operating system ever.\nBut some users on community forums say Windows 11 no longer needs antivirus software. So, let\u0026rsquo;s break this myth together by examining the whole situation. So you can use your system without any fear.\nAntivirus on Windows 11  Windows Defender on Windows 11  Windows 11 already has a free antivirus built into the operating system, namely Windows Defender which is activated by default when you turn on the computer. Initially Windows Defender doesn\u0026rsquo;t activate right away by default, so you need to set it up yourself. But starting Windows 10, this program is active by default. This means that you who are currently using Windows 11 no longer need to set Windows Defender on.\nAlthough Windows Defender is free, its ability to protect your device and data from viruses, ransomware, trojans, and other malicious programs is unquestionable.\nFor most users, Windows Defender is sufficient and can be relied upon as the only antivirus on Windows 11. Moreover, it is integrated with Windows 11, it remains light and does not burden the system while remaining strong against virus threats in real time.\nBut there are some users who still feel they need an antivirus for reasons of added security. There is nothing wrong with installing an antivirus on Windows 11. But you need to note, computer performance becomes a bit heavy because now there are two antiviruses that are active.\nThere are also users who say that Windows Defender is less than optimal in dealing with viruses because it lacks updates compared to paid antiviruses. Yes, there is a price and there is quality. But…\nAs long as you only visit trusted sites and can tell which download links are genuine or just advertisements, Windows Defender is enough to protect your system from virus attacks. Tips to keep Windows 11 safe from viruses Actually, these are general tips that can be applied to all operating systems, both for desktop and mobile.\n Do not arbitrarily receive data from anyone via flash media or the like. When browsing the internet, avoid clicking on fake download links, you should be able to tell the difference. Usually fake download links are made more attractive than real download links. Be careful when downloading file attachments or when clicking links in unfamiliar emails. Don\u0026rsquo;t install any apps you get from the internet or your friends.

Then Microsoft released the Microsoft Defender application that you can download individually, because it is not a default application with the Windows operating system.\nMicrosoft Defender on Windows acts more like a dashboard than trying to replace Windows\u0026rsquo; built-in security apps. Its presence is more about embodiment development, becoming a separate application that acts as a one stop solution designed to be easy to use for individuals and family members.\nThe Microsoft Defender antivirus application comes as a free antivirus, but with a note, users must have a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription. Microsoft does not provide the option to subscribe to the antivirus only. So for users who have subscribed to Microsoft 365, get extra protection for free.\nDifferences between Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender The presence of this new antivirus application is indeed a little confusing because the names are almost the same, namely Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender. Some people even think Microsoft Defender is Windows Defender, in fact it is two different applications.

Why is that? this is because not everyone can adjust the specifications of the laptop to their needs.\nThe number of types of laptops on the market is also a consideration. Especially for someone who is getting to know this device for the first time, they may be confused by the price, brand or even the shape of the laptop.\nThere are laptops that look ordinary, but they are very expensive. There are also those that look luxurious and cool but the price is not too expensive. But one thing you need to know, whether the laptop is expensive or not depends on the specifications listed.\nTherefore, choosing the right laptop will be the main discussion in the review of the best laptop brands so that the laptop is durable and long lasting.\nHow to choose the right and good laptop  How to choose a laptop?  For someone who is still early in using laptops, it is natural to be confused about which device to choose. For that you need to follow the guidelines in determining the best laptop and according to your needs.\n1. Laptop Size  Laptop Size  The first consideration in choosing a laptop is the size of the laptop which is the most basic thing. Even so, you need to pay attention to the size of the laptop because it cannot be upgraded like RAM or storage media.\nLaptop sizes usually start from 11 inches to 17 inches, which means that the larger the size of the laptop, the heavier it will be.\nUltra portable (under 13 inch)\nIf portability is a priority, a laptop with a size of 12 inches will really help you in its use because it will be easy to carry when traveling.\nPortable (13 – 14.9 inches)\nLaptops with a size of 13 – 14.9 inches are the perfect size. You can get the best balance between portability and functionality.\nStandard (15 – 15.6 inches)\nCurrently, laptops with a size of 15 – 15.6 inches are popular. This size is considered normal because it is not too big or small. Like a 13-inch laptop, many types of laptops with a size of 15 – 15.6 inches offer a thin and light design, so they are still comfortable for you to take on the go.\nLarge (17.3 inches and up)\nA large laptop is better if you use it for graphics-related purposes, such as video editing, designing, playing heavy games, and so on. Laptops of this size are usually equipped with high-speed processors and spacious storage media. Unfortunately, a laptop with a size of 17.3 inches is not comfortable to carry around because of its large size and weight.\nSo, which laptop size suits your needs?\n2. Type of storage media  HDD or SSD?  Tips:\n Choose SSD because it is faster.  There are two types of storage on laptops, namely hard drives and SSDs (Solid-state drives). These two types of storage have their respective advantages and disadvantages.\nHard disk prices tend to be cheap and have larger storage capacities, but the speed is very slow.\nSSD prices are more expensive for small but super-fast storage capacities because of the new technology in SSDs.\nFor now, most of the latest laptops have switched to SSDs and are starting to leave the hard drive.\n3. RAM Capacity Tips:\n Ideally 8GB RAM. For gaming or editing purposes, 16GB is highly recommended. The function of RAM is to temporarily store data from the system or applications. Everything you do now should be able to fit into RAM.  If the RAM capacity is too small or you run out of RAM due to opening too many applications, you will not be able to open anything else because the laptop is stuck and needs to be restarted.\nIf you are a student working with Office applications only, 6GB of RAM is sufficient. However, if you are a gamer or designer, 16GB of RAM is highly recommended.\n4. Screen Quality Tips:\n Choose LED screen.  There are two types of screens on laptops, namely LED (Light Emitting Diode) and LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).\nLED is a technology that is currently popular compared to LCD, the screen output is also better, but consumes a bit more power. On the other hand, LCD output is not as good as LED, but consumes less power.\n5. Processor  AMD and Intel  Tips:\n The newer the generation of a processor, the better. For gaming and design needs, it is recommended to use Core i5 (Intel) or Ryzen 5 (AMD). Take a look at the benchmark results to see how the performance compares.  Currently there are two well-known processor brands, namely Intel and AMD. It is highly recommended to choose a laptop with the latest series processor.\n6. Check Webcam  Laptop webcams  The need for webcams is now becoming more frequent because many people work from home or study online. Make sure the laptop you choose has a webcam.\nIf you choose a laptop without a webcam, you can purchase an external webcam which is sold separately.\n7. Laptop Brand  Laptop Brand  Quality, reliable and technical support for laptops is also strongly supported by the background of the company that produces it. The brand name is part of what makes your laptop of choice valuable.\nYou have to consider how manufacturers face the competition in terms of design, price and quality.\nMake sure the laptop you choose comes from a trusted manufacturer.\n10 Best Laptop Brand \u0026amp; Prices (2022) The following is a list of the best laptop brands and their prices for the 2022 version of Gawetech.\n1.
