Mod APKs in games can make users feel premium features for free, such as all game progress, lots of in-game money, high levels, etc. While the application is the same, users can experience premium features for free. Not only unlocking premium features, there are also applications that do not feature in the official application, in the mod application there are even.\nAs a result, many smartphone users are tempted by the lure of the features offered. Without spending a penny, users can sample premium features for free even if it\u0026rsquo;s illegal.\nWhat is a Mod APK?  Mod Application  A mod application is a modified application developed by an unofficial third-party developer with additional features, making it more interesting than the official application. The mod application does not come from the original developer or is illegal.\nIs APK Mod Safe? Even though it feels safe, you have to know what risks you can take when using the modified application.\nActually on Android there is already a prevention if users install applications from unknown sources. For example, persist in installing, users must be forced to change permissions to install applications from unknown sources in the settings menu.\nFrom here Android has warned that changing permission settings is actually dangerous.\nWhat are the Dangers of Mod APKs? Mod applications do provide what users need, such as premium features that should be paid for free and unlimited.\nBut behind it all, the risk of installing mod applications always lurks.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see what are the dangers that can occur when using a mod application.\n1. Banned Not infrequently, application or game mod user accounts are banned for using third-party applications.\nThe developer will usually indicate player accounts that have unusual activities such as suddenly having unlimited points and the like even though there are no purchase transactions. Usually users who cheat will be permanently blocked within a certain time.\nEven in the worst case, the developer can ban the device. This means that your smartphone will no longer be able to use the application or game even if you change to a new account.\n2. Virus Infection Mod applications have a low security risk because the initial code that has been created by the developer is changed or redesigned. If the conversion process is not correct, it can cause a security flaw in the application which may allow your data to be infected with viruses.\nIn addition, irresponsible third parties can create mod applications that have been inserted with viruses and can damage your smartphone.\n3. Trigger Adware App modifiers also want to take advantage of the APKs they\u0026rsquo;ve restructured. The modified APK is inserted with ads that can appear suddenly and the ads that appear are very annoying and irrelevant to our interests.\nThe solution to this problem, you can install an antivirus which can remove the adware. You can see applications that can remove adware at the following link:\nRemove Annoying Adware (Malware Ads) for All Devices\n4. Your Privacy Is Threatened Privacy is very important, especially personal data should not be leaked to irresponsible parties because it can be misused.\nIrresponsible third parties can take your personal data through the login account on the mod application that you are using.\nMod applications can also tap all data and activity on your smartphone. Moreover, we do not know who developed the mod application.\nConclusion By using a mod application, it means that you have opened a security hole on your smartphone. Your smartphone is prone to viruses, adware, and personal data leaks.\nWhen viewed from the risk, it is very detrimental when compared to the benefits of application features or mod games which are not much.\nAlways use original applications from official developers that you can get on trusted platforms like Google PlayStore.\n","image":"/images/install-apk-mod_hu4c7041e494980f9f86b52b5813b131d4_40224_420x280_fill_q100_h2_box_smart1.webp","permalink":"https://gawetech.com/install-apk-mod/","tags":null,"title":"Beware, Installing Mod APKs for Smartphones Can Be Dangerous"},{"categories":["Apps"],"contents":"The most common adware around us is Adware that infects browsers like chrome, firefox, etc. which are able to install and replace the default search engine. As a result, the browser we are using appears a lot of unwanted and very annoying Ads. The advertisements displayed by the adware are also irrelevant to our interests.\nWhat is Adware? Adware or advertising-supported software is software developed to distribute automatic advertisements into the user interface of a software or screen that the user is currently opening.\nAdware belongs to the category of malware or malicious software, intrusive software that can make your computer\u0026rsquo;s performance decrease because it appears a lot of advertisements and even distributes users\u0026rsquo; personal data.\nWhere Does Adware Come From? If you look at the majority of cases of adware victims, the main cause of a device being infected with malware is the activity of the user itself.\nAdware can infiltrate computers, laptops, and android when you download applications from unknown sources. The application could have been infiltrated by scripts containing adware. Then when the application you download and then install, your device can be infected with adware.\nThe solution to this problem is to make sure you download the application from a trusted source such as the PlayStore, AppStore, or the official web application.\nAnother source that can cause your device to become infected with adware is the websites you visit while browsing. When browsing, sometimes users unknowingly click on a pop-up containing a notification to install an application.\nWhat is the Difference Between Adware and Viruses? Adware and viruses both have differences in how they work and form of attack.\nAdware is more intended to distribute advertisements to users, while viruses are a type of malware that attacks hardware with the aim of finding users\u0026rsquo; personal information or disrupting operating system performance.\nRead also:\nDo I Need to Install Antivirus on Windows 11?\n8 New Differences Microsoft Defender vs. Windows Defender\nWhat are the Impacts of Adware? Adware can cause the use of internet quota to be wasteful, because the malware continues to synchronize with the ad server to display various adverts in turn.\nIf your data usage is increasing, it is suspect, there may be adware already installed on your computer.\nFrom a user experience perspective, Adware can interfere with your productivity at work. Adware can appear suddenly pop-up ads either on your computer, laptop or cellphone.\nThe pop-up ad content that appears is also very disruptive, ranging from gambling ads, adult ads, to credit card offers and investments that can make users suddenly rich.\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t worry, the Adware can still be completely blocked so that the Adware can\u0026rsquo;t appear again.

Norton 360 – Best Adware Removal Software  Norton 360 – Best Adware Removal Software  Norton 360 is GaweTech\u0026rsquo;s best version of Adware detector and remover. In the test sample, Norton was able to flag every Adware roaming around on Windows, MacBook, and Android phones from deceptive pop-up ads to sophisticated browser hijackers.\nApart from blocking Adware, Norton also identifies and blocks all spyware and ransomware files. In fact, many ransomware files fail to be caught by other antiviruses.\nNorton 360 also has other internet security features, namely:\n Anti-phishing protection. VPN. Webcam protection. Cloud backups. Dark web monitoring. Identity theft protection (US only).  2. Avira – Best Free Antivirus with Advanced Adware Detection  Avira – Best Free Antivirus with Advanced Adware Detection  Avira has a very good free version with a powerful adware removal tool. In the test sample, this Antivirus was able to block and remove all adware, including adware that was automatically downloaded to the device without the user\u0026rsquo;s knowledge.\nAvira is also equipped with a \u0026ldquo;PUA Shield\u0026rdquo; which can alert users if there are potentially unwanted advertisements joining legitimate software. Most adware scanners only detect malicious files once they are downloaded, but Avira warns you beforehand.\nAvira also has an anti-malware scanner that runs in the cloud. Scans all available trojans, ransomware, spyware, keyloggers by blocking them all.\nAvira also provides free internet security features such as:\n VPN Browser extension  Avira browser extension is very good, useful for preventing phishing attacks, blocking ads and web trackers, and flagging obscure websites.\n3.

The three modes have almost the same function in turning off the laptop. Because the functions are almost the same, you should consider before turning off the laptop.\n Windows 11 shutdown and sleep buttons  This equation makes some users don\u0026rsquo;t really care about choosing shutdown, sleep, or hibernate when they turn off the laptop. So let\u0026rsquo;s explore these three options by examining all situations, which one is best to use and when.\nWhat is Sleep mode? Sleep mode is a power-saving option because it saves all open files, software, and other data in the computer\u0026rsquo;s main memory (RAM). Sleep mode has become a common option on laptops. Most laptops will enter sleep mode when you close the laptop. Sleep mode can be activated from the Start menu (Windows) or Apple menu (Mac).\n When the laptop is in sleep state, RAM is constantly awake and draws power from the battery or wall outlet. While the rest of the computer is off like the screen, processor, hard drive, attached drives, etc.\n When you want to turn on the computer again with the power button, all open files, software, and other data will be recalled.\nAdvantages of Sleep Mode:\n It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get started by simply closing the laptop. Restores all open files, software and other data instantly. RAM uses less battery power to save your work.  Disadvantages of Sleep Mode:\n The battery can still be drained when in sleep mode. Computer RAM never rests it can even become full or overloaded.  When to use Sleep mode? Sleep mode is the best option when you just leave your laptop for a while or when you know you want to come back soon.\nYou can use sleep mode when:\n Change location to return to work. Take a break to eat.  On most computers, you just need to open the laptop or press the power button to return to your screen exactly where it was.\nSleep mode is not a great option when you are away from a power source because sleep mode drains your battery gradually. For example, if you are on a long trip and the laptop won\u0026rsquo;t be plugged in for a few hours or days.\nMost laptops will usually enter hibernation mode after a few hours of sleep in order to save battery while keeping all open files, software, and other data.\nWhat is Hibernate mode? Hibernate mode is at first glance similar to sleep mode, but there are some differences that make hibernate mode better for certain situations.\n Putting the computer in hibernate mode will shut down the laptop completely and take no power at all. All open files, software, and other data are packaged in a hibernation file stored on the hard drive.\n This mode is similar to when you save progress while playing a game and then turn off the device. When you reopen the game, the game will continue your progress as before.\nThe difference with sleep mode is that in hibernate mode the computer takes a while (a few seconds to a few minutes) to create a hibernation file and reboots when you turn it on again.\nThe point is hibernate mode takes a few moments, while instant sleep mode, does not take time.\nAdvantages of hibernate mode:\n Secure all progress on the hard drive. Does not consume battery or power outlet at all.  Disadvantages of hibernate mode:\n Takes longer to hibernate and boot back up than sleep mode. Not all operating systems embed the hibernate button by default, there needs to be other settings so that the button can appear.  When to use Hibernate mode? Hibernate mode is usually the best option when you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use your computer for a while, but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to save a lot of files you opened manually and reopen all programs.\nHibernate mode is the best option when you know you can\u0026rsquo;t plug your computer into a power outlet for a while but want to save your progress.\nHibernate mode will be useful for work trips, for example you are at the airport or station without electricity for a few hours but you want to continue your progress again.\nHibernate mode is not great for a short break from work, as the computer takes a while to create the hibernation file and takes longer boot times.\nWhat is Shutdown mode? Shutting down the computer means closing all software, files, and processes. This mode clears the memory in RAM, so that when you turn on the computer again, your computer becomes light as if there was no load.\nSince everything has to be completely closed for the computer to shut down, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to save your work first. You also can\u0026rsquo;t resume the last progress you left without opening them all again.\nAdvantages of shutdown mode:\n Empty RAM can make a laptop run more smoothly. Uses no power at all.  Disadvantages of shutdown mode:\n It\u0026rsquo;s not easy or quick to get back to work. Can lose progress when you forget not to save your file.  When to turn off the laptop completely? Turning off the laptop is better if you have finished work and don\u0026rsquo;t need the laptop for a long time such as on the weekend or don\u0026rsquo;t have important work to continue immediately.\nIn some cases like the open application is stuck and many background processes make the laptop run slower.\nThe easiest way to solve this performance issue, apart from closing non-essential programs you can use shutdown mode and restart your laptop.\nShutdown mode isn\u0026rsquo;t a great option when you\u0026rsquo;re going back quickly to get on with your work.\nConclusion With the existence of several modes of turning off the laptop such as shutdown, sleep, and hibernate, it makes it easier for users to determine when the right time to use one of the three modes is. The three modes have their respective advantages and disadvantages. So, adjust to your needs.\n","image":"/images/shutdown-sleep-hibernate_hu840e875fa7d219a276c8dc997cbe3218_26888_420x280_fill_q100_h2_box_smart1.webp","permalink":"https://gawetech.com/shutdown-sleep-hibernate/","tags":null,"title":"Shutdown, Sleep or Hibernate.

When Microsoft launched Windows 11, they declared it to be the most secure version of the operating system ever.\nBut some users on community forums say Windows 11 no longer needs antivirus software. So, let\u0026rsquo;s break this myth together by examining the whole situation. So you can use your system without any fear.\nAntivirus on Windows 11  Windows Defender on Windows 11  Windows 11 already has a free antivirus built into the operating system, namely Windows Defender which is activated by default when you turn on the computer. Initially Windows Defender doesn\u0026rsquo;t activate right away by default, so you need to set it up yourself. But starting Windows 10, this program is active by default. This means that you who are currently using Windows 11 no longer need to set Windows Defender on.\nAlthough Windows Defender is free, its ability to protect your device and data from viruses, ransomware, trojans, and other malicious programs is unquestionable.\nFor most users, Windows Defender is sufficient and can be relied upon as the only antivirus on Windows 11. Moreover, it is integrated with Windows 11, it remains light and does not burden the system while remaining strong against virus threats in real time.\nBut there are some users who still feel they need an antivirus for reasons of added security. There is nothing wrong with installing an antivirus on Windows 11. But you need to note, computer performance becomes a bit heavy because now there are two antiviruses that are active.\nThere are also users who say that Windows Defender is less than optimal in dealing with viruses because it lacks updates compared to paid antiviruses. Yes, there is a price and there is quality. But…\nAs long as you only visit trusted sites and can tell which download links are genuine or just advertisements, Windows Defender is enough to protect your system from virus attacks. Tips to keep Windows 11 safe from viruses Actually, these are general tips that can be applied to all operating systems, both for desktop and mobile.\n Do not arbitrarily receive data from anyone via flash media or the like. When browsing the internet, avoid clicking on fake download links, you should be able to tell the difference. Usually fake download links are made more attractive than real download links. Be careful when downloading file attachments or when clicking links in unfamiliar emails. Don\u0026rsquo;t install any apps you get from the internet or your friends.

Then Microsoft released the Microsoft Defender application that you can download individually, because it is not a default application with the Windows operating system.\nMicrosoft Defender on Windows acts more like a dashboard than trying to replace Windows\u0026rsquo; built-in security apps. Its presence is more about embodiment development, becoming a separate application that acts as a one stop solution designed to be easy to use for individuals and family members.\nThe Microsoft Defender antivirus application comes as a free antivirus, but with a note, users must have a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family subscription. Microsoft does not provide the option to subscribe to the antivirus only. So for users who have subscribed to Microsoft 365, get extra protection for free.\nDifferences between Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender The presence of this new antivirus application is indeed a little confusing because the names are almost the same, namely Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender. Some people even think Microsoft Defender is Windows Defender, in fact it is two different applications. So what is the difference between Microsoft Defender and Windows Defender?\nWindows Defender  Windows Defender on Windows 11   Free. No need to install, has become the default windows.

Why is that? this is because not everyone can adjust the specifications of the laptop to their needs.\nThe number of types of laptops on the market is also a consideration. Especially for someone who is getting to know this device for the first time, they may be confused by the price, brand or even the shape of the laptop.\nThere are laptops that look ordinary, but they are very expensive. There are also those that look luxurious and cool but the price is not too expensive. But one thing you need to know, whether the laptop is expensive or not depends on the specifications listed.\nTherefore, choosing the right laptop will be the main discussion in the review of the best laptop brands so that the laptop is durable and long lasting.\nHow to choose the right and good laptop  How to choose a laptop?  For someone who is still early in using laptops, it is natural to be confused about which device to choose. For that you need to follow the guidelines in determining the best laptop and according to your needs.\n1. Laptop Size  Laptop Size  The first consideration in choosing a laptop is the size of the laptop which is the most basic thing. Even so, you need to pay attention to the size of the laptop because it cannot be upgraded like RAM or storage media.\nLaptop sizes usually start from 11 inches to 17 inches, which means that the larger the size of the laptop, the heavier it will be.\nUltra portable (under 13 inch)\nIf portability is a priority, a laptop with a size of 12 inches will really help you in its use because it will be easy to carry when traveling.\nPortable (13 – 14.9 inches)\nLaptops with a size of 13 – 14.9 inches are the perfect size. You can get the best balance between portability and functionality.\nStandard (15 – 15.6 inches)\nCurrently, laptops with a size of 15 – 15.6 inches are popular. This size is considered normal because it is not too big or small. Like a 13-inch laptop, many types of laptops with a size of 15 – 15.6 inches offer a thin and light design, so they are still comfortable for you to take on the go.\nLarge (17.3 inches and up)\nA large laptop is better if you use it for graphics-related purposes, such as video editing, designing, playing heavy games, and so on. Laptops of this size are usually equipped with high-speed processors and spacious storage media. Unfortunately, a laptop with a size of 17.3 inches is not comfortable to carry around because of its large size and weight.\nSo, which laptop size suits your needs?\n2. Type of storage media  HDD or SSD?  Tips:\n Choose SSD because it is faster.  There are two types of storage on laptops, namely hard drives and SSDs (Solid-state drives). These two types of storage have their respective advantages and disadvantages.\nHard disk prices tend to be cheap and have larger storage capacities, but the speed is very slow.\nSSD prices are more expensive for small but super-fast storage capacities because of the new technology in SSDs.\nFor now, most of the latest laptops have switched to SSDs and are starting to leave the hard drive.\n3. RAM Capacity Tips:\n Ideally 8GB RAM. For gaming or editing purposes, 16GB is highly recommended. The function of RAM is to temporarily store data from the system or applications. Everything you do now should be able to fit into RAM.  If the RAM capacity is too small or you run out of RAM due to opening too many applications, you will not be able to open anything else because the laptop is stuck and needs to be restarted.\nIf you are a student working with Office applications only, 6GB of RAM is sufficient. However, if you are a gamer or designer, 16GB of RAM is highly recommended.\n4. Screen Quality Tips:\n Choose LED screen.  There are two types of screens on laptops, namely LED (Light Emitting Diode) and LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).\nLED is a technology that is currently popular compared to LCD, the screen output is also better, but consumes a bit more power. On the other hand, LCD output is not as good as LED, but consumes less power.\n5. Processor  AMD and Intel  Tips:\n The newer the generation of a processor, the better. For gaming and design needs, it is recommended to use Core i5 (Intel) or Ryzen 5 (AMD). Take a look at the benchmark results to see how the performance compares.  Currently there are two well-known processor brands, namely Intel and AMD. It is highly recommended to choose a laptop with the latest series processor.\n6. Check Webcam  Laptop webcams  The need for webcams is now becoming more frequent because many people work from home or study online. Make sure the laptop you choose has a webcam.\nIf you choose a laptop without a webcam, you can purchase an external webcam which is sold separately.\n7. Laptop Brand  Laptop Brand  Quality, reliable and technical support for laptops is also strongly supported by the background of the company that produces it. The brand name is part of what makes your laptop of choice valuable.\nYou have to consider how manufacturers face the competition in terms of design, price and quality.\nMake sure the laptop you choose comes from a trusted manufacturer.\n10 Best Laptop Brand \u0026amp; Prices (2022) The following is a list of the best laptop brands and their prices for the 2022 version of Gawetech.\n1.
